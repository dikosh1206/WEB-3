## üåü Overview

**Morning Crust** is a warm and aesthetic caf√©-themed website designed to represent a modern coffee shop.  
This version (Assignment #5) enhances the previous HTML/CSS project by adding **interactive JavaScript features** ‚Äî  
including form validation, FAQ accordion, popup subscription form, dynamic background color changes,  
and real-time date/time display.

The goal was to make the website more **dynamic and user-friendly** while keeping the same visual style from Assignment #4.
