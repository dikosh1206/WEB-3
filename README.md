# Morning Crust — Responsive Website

**Team:** Bald Baldies  
**Members:** Amanzhol Aldiyar, Kalzhanov Zhansultan

**Short Summary:**  
A responsive café/bakery website built using Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS media queries.  
The design follows a cozy, warm “coffee shop” aesthetic inspired by Pinterest.  
It includes a carousel, menu page, responsive cards, contact form, and an About page.  
One page (`cards.html`) is built **without Bootstrap**, using **pure CSS media queries**, as required.
